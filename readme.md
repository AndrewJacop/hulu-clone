This project include a lot of experimental features and technologies for a Front End Beginner Developer

- I used pure CSS3 for the Stream and Movie page
- and used Bootstrap (v5.3.2) and SASS for the Home page
- also added (almost) fully responsive styling for the whole site
- and used an external javascript free module called Swiper (v11) for auto swiping effect
- Custom fonts, Custom Scroll Bar
- simple API 'GET' functionality to add the movies automatically (after importing a static version for testing the styling mid developing)
- and finally, used Local Storage and Session Storage to mimic the (FAKE) functionality of logging in and registering new users
  (the home screen will prompt you to register if you used any button, and after you register for the firs time - as long as you don't clear your cache - you will be prompted only to log in next time, and if you choose to, the website can save your credentiols and let you stay locked in.... with a fake user img as a log out button in the main screen)
